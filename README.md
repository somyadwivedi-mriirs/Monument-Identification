## Problem:
We often don't know or forget the name of monument we visit. Monument Identification can help to recognize it from images or in real time. 
Our project will predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections.
## Dataset:
300 Images
- 6 Classes: (50 images each)
        -Taj Mahal, India Gate, Qutub Minar, Gateway of India, Char Minar and Victoria Memorial
